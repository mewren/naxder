Goblins vs Gnomes Expansion
Goblins vs Gnomes (GvG) is the first Hearthstone expansion. Unlike Naxxramas, Hearthstone's first adventure, GvG will have no bosses, and the over 120 cards being added will come from new GvG packs you can purchase for the same cost as the existing Classic packs (previously called Expert packs). The new set includes a number of cards with random targeting or effects. The highly anticipated spectator mode feature and a new board will also arrive with the expansion's release.
